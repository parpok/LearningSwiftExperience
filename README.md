# LearningSwiftExperience

In this repository I'm learning Swift and sharing my basic coding experiences.

## What I want to accomplish with this repository?

I want to create a basic CLI (Command Line Interface) application that will provide some basic functions like basic math, some prints, input and output, etc.
Basically everything that I usually shown on the programming courses/classes/lessons.

## BUT WHY????

I want to get into making iOS Apps. Swift is natively supported on iOS so I think it's a great place to start for mobile while taking iOS into consideration. Yes I know without a Mac it doesn't really make sense. And yes I know that for Android I don't need to spend a lot of money for a computer with an Apple logo (or try some sketchy hackintosh stuff) but I'm not really interested in Android development and I have an iPhone so I want to make apps for it. XD

### What am I doing here?

Stuff you see here is mostly taken from [Swift Documentation/Books](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/)
Yes it smells like tutorial hell and since some Chat-GPT was used it could also smell like GPT Hell XDD

### TODO

- [ ]  Make some CLI interface to make it more user friendly to use the functions.
<!-- - [ ] Format the code to make it compatible with [Swift-DooC](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/docc) I'm not a Mac user(currently). Basic documentation inside this basic code should be enough-->
- [x] Basic math
- [x] Basic input and output
- [x] Basic math operations
- [x] Values like ints, doubles, floats and other number things

#### Optional things TODO

- [ ] Try doing some Ci/Cd stuff with GitHub Actions to build the project for different platforms
- [ ] Maybe some tests?

## How to run the damm thing

- Clone this repo

- RN edit the main.swift file to your liking (or not)
- run `swift run` in the root directory of the project
