# LearningSwiftExperience

In this repository I'm learning Swift and sharing my basic coding experiences.

## What I want to accomplish with this repository?

I want to create a basic CLI (Command Line Interface) application that will provide some basic functions like basic math, some prints, input and output, etc.
Basically everything that I usually shown on the programming courses/classes/lessons.

## BUT WHY????

I want to get into making iOS Apps. Swift is natively supported on iOS so I think it's a great place to start for mobile while taking iOS into consideration. Yes I know without a Mac it doesn't really make sense. And yes I know that for Android I don't need to spend a lot of money for a computer with an Apple logo (or try some sketchy hackintosh stuff) but I'm not really interested in Android development and I have an iPhone so I want to make apps for it. XD
