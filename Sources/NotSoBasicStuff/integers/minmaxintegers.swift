/// This function explores min and max values of integers and even adds them up
func minmaxints(){
    let minint = Int64.min // minimal 64 bit integer
    let maxint = Int64(Int8.max) // maximum 8 bit integer
    let wtf:Int64 = minint + maxint // adding them up
    print("The minimum integer value is \(minint)")

    print(wtf) // printing the results
    
    // Lets be honest this code sure its simple. It prints minimum 64 bit interger and maximum 8 bit integer - adds them up and shows their addition
    // But what is the point of this code? I mean I guess it shows that you can add up different types of integers and get a result but why would you want to do that?
    // Also used Integer Conversion here. Cool ðŸ˜Ž
